# Mod Template

This is a multi-loader mod template for Fabric and Neoforge utilizing stonecutter. This is the Java-only version 
of mod-template-kotlin.
It's largely been adapted from KikuGie's Elytra Trims rewrite following major feature updates to Stonecutter. 
Feel free to use, although be aware that no support is officially offered or guaranteed.

### Configure your project first in `gradle.properties`!
