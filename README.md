# Think Before Drop

A mod which can prevent you from dropping rare items.

**We will only update 1.20+ and other versions have stopped maintaining.**

If you press Q to drop specific items (can be set up in the config gui), it will not drop them and ask you to press Q
again in a time limit to confirm dropping. The time limit also can be set up in the config gui and the default value is
0.5 - 5 seconds.

**For 1.x version**, require Malilib as dependency.

**For 2.x version**, Cloth Config is needed and open config screen with ModMenu.

**For 3.x version (1.20+)**, Jupiter is needed and open config screen with ModMenu.
